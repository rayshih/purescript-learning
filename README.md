# My Purescript Learning Notes

This a repo that record my learning process of learning purescript.

I created this repo to share my learning experience of purescript.
Hope I can help more and more people get into know the beauty of functional programming.

Welcome to leave any things as issues, like any parts that you don't understand or any suggestions.
I mean ANYTHING!

## Some notices before start

I'm trying to target the very newcomers, like someone doesn't have any programming experience.
So if there are some things need more advanced knowledge, I'll simply mark them as "medium" or
"advanced" and won't describe the detail, and then carry on.

## Current: Pux

Let's start with web app!

There are several frameworks can be used, and I think the most easier one to start with is Pux.

Here is the official Pux website: <http://purescript-pux.org/>

Let's start:

Step 1:

Install npm, git.

Npm is the tool related to JavaScript environment. And Git is a tool for version control.
We don't need to learn the details of them for now.

Step 2:

Clone the starter project:

```bash
// Open your terminal and type following commands

// Just clone a template project into folder `1-pux-hello-world`
git clone git://github.com/alexmingoia/pux-starter-app.git 1-pux-hello-world

// Change directory into this folder
cd 1-pux-hello-world

// Install the dependencies
npm install

// Run the project
npm start
```


My Targets:

1. Hello World - create a runnable project
2. Offline Todo List - modify the hello world project into a todo list without using API

## Next things to learn

- Server side programming


## More Learning Materials

Here are some reading materials that I've read before start this repository.

1. [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read)
2. [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

However, it's not necessary to read these before checking this repo.
I'll try my best to describe any detail, and hope that it is extrememly easy to
understand, even for the person who haven't done any programming before.
