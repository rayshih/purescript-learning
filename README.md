# My Purescript Learning Notes

This a repo that record my learning process of learning purescript.

I created this repo to share my learning experience of purescript.
Hope I can help more and more people get into know the beauty of functional programming.

Here are some reading materials that I've read before start this repository.

1. [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read)
2. [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)

However, it's not necessary to read these before checking this repo.
I'll try my best to describe any detail, and hope that it is extrememly easy to
understand, even for the person who haven't done any programming before.

## Current: Pux


## Next things to learn

- Server side programming
